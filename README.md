# AI Tools Assignment – Task 2: Iris Classification with Scikit-learn

##  Overview

This notebook completes **Task 2** of the Practical Implementation section of the AI Tools and Applications assignment. It focuses on using **Scikit-learn** to build a machine learning model that classifies **Iris flower species** based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Files Included

- Iris study.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with full code and comments
- Iris.csv – Dataset used for training and evaluation

##  What Was Done

- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- Handled missing values (none found)
- Encoded the species labels into numbers
- Trained a `DecisionTreeClassifier`
- Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, and recall

## Results

- Model achieved **100% accuracy** on test data
- Precision, recall, and F1-score for all classes: **1.00**

## Tools Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
